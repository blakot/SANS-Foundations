# SANS Foundations

Applied learning from [SANS SEC275: Foundations](https://www.sans-foundations.com), a course in computers, technology, and security foundations that are needed to kickstart a career in cybersecurity. I earned a free enrollment voucher for this course as a [National Cyber Scholar](https://badgr.com/public/assertions/fpTTQQw5TmS6n5ca2BS7EA), an award granted to players ranking in the top 2% of CyberStart players and picoCTF players.

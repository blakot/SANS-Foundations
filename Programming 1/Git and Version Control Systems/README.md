## The Repository

A repository (or repo) is the place where a project lives. You can "clone" a repository to your computer, taking a copy of it at that point in time.

You can make changes to your cloned repository files. Note that in the screenshot above, the README for the SANS Foundations repo does not have a "CLONED IN" heading, but we can edit that heading into our cloned README file.
